# Using RStudio seems still quite fine, loading files to GitHub seems still
# a bit unclear and I hope I will get more comfortable with it as the course
# goes on.
# Exercise set 1. was quite extensive, most was familiar/known, but it's not
# bad to refresh your memory.

There seems to be many new things to learn, especially with  GitHub with me.
Learning to work with GitHub, as mentioned, I am expecting to improve during
the course, as well as statistics on large data sets with R.

The Exercise1.Rmd-file had nice summary on handling the data in R in chapters
1 & 2. Some of them I had gotten more familiar with, but there where a lot of
things to learn, especially chapter 2 had nice suggestions/tricks in the
examples how to handle data frames.
