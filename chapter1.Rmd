There seems to be many new things to learn, especially with GitHub with me.
Learning to work with GitHub, as mentioned, I am expected to improve during
the course, as well as statistics on large data sets with R.

The Exercise1.Rmd-file had nice summary on handling the data in R in chapters
1 & 2. Some of them I had gotten more familiar with, but there where a lot of
things to learn, especially chapter 2 had nice suggestions/tricks in the
examples how to handle data frames.
