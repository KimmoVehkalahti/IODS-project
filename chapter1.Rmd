This course was recommended by a friend who is in the masters program in data science at the University of Helsinki. Data science, big data analytics, machine learning are the next generation skill set everyone is recommended to acquire and here I am. I am a bit nervous, very exited and mostly curious to take a dive into the world of data science. 

# About the project

I have only had some time to browse through the R for Health Data Science. Coming from a background of experimental epidemiology, I was drawn immediately by linear and logistic regression because this is something I often rely on in my work. I looked into survival analysis briefly because of my intrest and found it quite interesting. Although I need to practice a lot before I can get my hands around the analysis. I think the book gives a great over view of essential statistical analysis required on a fundamental level. Some knowledge of statistics can be of great advantage as R platform is already designed with a steep learning curve.
