I have always always been fasinated by numbers and enjoy doing basic statistics. So i was excited wen i got a mail about this course, but i was a bit drawn back when i read we had to use R because i have no prior knowledge of programming. But so far i have enjoyed the introduction to R, and i am looking forward to the more interesting stuffs, I'm going to learn from this course.
