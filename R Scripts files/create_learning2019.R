# creating a data analysis set with (gender, age, attiutude, deep, stra, surf and points) (task2)
# since struggled las time with this will redo using all steps in Data Camp and tidyr
#
# print the "Attitude" column vector of the lrn14 data
lrn14$Attitude
# divide each number in the column vector
lrn14$Attitude / 10

# The step with (dlyr) library ... Need to access (this was not easy last time and had to look a while for it)
# 
# Access the dplyr library
library(dplyr)
# Seems to still state that some parts are masked, missing.. 
# filter and lag from stats and 4 objects from pkg base >>>
# Well I hope we do not need them allthough filter seems relevant ; )
# >>>> I activated 2 more packages in Studio " stats4" and "base64" already within the listed ones and now seems to get diplyr fine : ) 
# Lucky or resourcefull, either way ok for now.
