## 1) Data wrangling exercises 

```{r}
#reading txt table from URL:
myfile <- read.table(url("https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS2-data.txt"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
#dimensions of the table
dim(myfile)
#table has 183 rows and 97 columns (variables)
colnames(myfile)
rownames(myfile)
#column names and row names listed

#Create an analysis dataset with the variables 
#Gender, Age, Attitude, Deep, Stra, Surf and Points
a <- subset(myfile, select=c(Gender,Age,Attitude, Deep, Stra, Surf, Points))
dim(a)
#Combination Variables are Attitude, Deep, Stra and Surf are scaled to mean
aa <- scale(a[,3:6],center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
a[,3:6] <- aa
dim(a)
#Deleting rows where Points=0
azero <- a[a$Points != 0,]
dim(azero)
#166 rows with 7 variables
library(tidyverse)
write_csv(x=azero, 'learning2014.csv', col_names = TRUE)
azeronew <- read_csv("learning2014.csv")
#table saved as csv-file, also able to open
```

## 2) Analysis exercises

```{r}
newfile <- read.table(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/Helsinki-Open-Data-Science/master/datasets/learning2014.txt"), sep = ",", header = TRUE)
dim(newfile) #166 rows and 7 columns
head(newfile)
colnames(newfile) 
#column names:"gender","age","attitude","deep","stra","surf","points"

###
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

summary(newfile)
table(newfile$gender)
ggpairs(newfile, lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
#as individuals mean values are age:25.5, attitude:3.143, deep:3.68, stra:3.12, surf:2.78, points:22.7
#there are 110 females, and 56 males
#there is significant correlation between surf-attitude*, points-attitude***, surf-deep*** and surf-stra*
#visually, attitude, stra, surf seem normally distributed

#choosing three variables: attitude, surf, stra
model = lm(points ~ attitude+surf+stra, data=newfile)
summary(model)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
#attitude with p-value 1.93e-08 *** seem highly significant in the model
#where as surf and stra are not significant to explain points
#model explains ~20% of variance of points (multiple r-squared)

#if we remove variables surf and stra we get model2
model2 = lm(points ~ attitude, data=newfile)
summary(model2)
#attitude explains significantly points but only 19% of variance (multiple r-squared)

#plotting models
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(model2)
#generally all the plots look good (model linear)
#top left: residuals vs fitted plot; close to zero (independent from each other), fitted values are forecasts of  observed values, residuals what are left out of forecast
#to right: QQ-plot; residuals compared to normal distribution seem very linear (on the line)
#low left: scale-location plot; absolute residuals values with fitted values, similar magnitudes of residuals across fitted values
#low right: residuals vs leverage plot; how far independent variables are from observations; no points with high residue and high leverage
