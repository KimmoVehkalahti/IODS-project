## Start me Up

The beggining of my journey in IODS course - week one. *To be honest day one or two.*

- Installed all necessary tools described in the course section **Start me Up!**. (R, Rstudio and GitHub).
- Got an extra open science and Research done (in finnish *Avoin tiede ja tutkimus*) and maybe will do the english part as well if time.
- Did the Data Camp -- __R Short and sweet__ exercises to fresh up some R and get started with it. 
- Remember how object oriented programming and using vectors and functions is really not that simple at all, but I will learn.
- I had some problems creating the link, but could be due to the recognition of author. GitHub was asking "who am I" that was quite funny at 3 am with not much sleep. Felt a little odd, like texting with AI.

## Regression and model validation

- tried to do all the work last week but failed so left all work to be done allover again during the submissionday...how else.
