This set consists of a few numbered exercises.
Go to each exercise in turn and do as follows:

1. Read the brief description of the exercise.
2. Run the (possible) pre-exercise-code chunk.
3. Follow the instructions to fix the R code!

## 2.0 INSTALL THE REQUIRED PACKAGES FIRST!

One or more extra packages (in addition to `tidyverse`) will be needed below.

```{r}
# Select (with mouse or arrow keys) the install.packages("...") and
# run it (by Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter):

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) 
library(finalfit)
library(broom)


```


## 2.1 Reading data from the web

The first step of data analysis with R is reading data into R. This is done with a function. Which function and function arguments to use to do this, depends on the original format of the data. 

Conveniently in R, the same functions for reading data can usually be used whether the data is saved locally on your computer or somewhere else behind a web URL.

After the correct function has been identified and data read into R, the data will usually be in R `data.frame` format. Te dimensions of a data frame are ($n$,$d$), where $n$ is the number of rows (the observations) and $d$ the number of columns (the variables).

**The purpose of this course is to expose you to some basic and more advanced tasks of programming and data analysis with R.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Pre-exercise-code (Run this code chunk first! Do NOT edit it.)

# Click the green arrow ("Run Current Chunk") in the upper-right corner of this chunk. This will initialize the R objects needed in the exercise. Then move to Instructions of the exercise to start working.

# (No pre-exercise code in this exercise! Just go on!)

```

### Instructions
- Read the `lrn14` data frame to memory with `read.table()`. There is information related to the data [here](http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-meta.txt)
- Use `dim()` on the data frame to look at the dimensions of the data. How many rows and colums does the data have?
- Look at the structure of the data with `str()`.

Hint:
- For both functions you can pass a data frame as the first (unnamed) argument.

### R code
```{r}
# This is a code chunk in RStudio editor.
# Work with the exercise in this chunk, step-by-step. Fix the R code!

# read the data into memory
lrn14 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-meta.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

# Look at the dimensions of the data

# Look at the structure of the data
#use .txt file to import data set for better description.
# Preliminary results available at http://www.slideshare.net/kimmovehkalahti/the-relationship-between-learning-approaches-and-students-achievements-in-an-introductory-statistics-course-in-finland
#Total respondents n=183, total question n=60, so 184 rows including heading and 60 columns
#The code as respective column heading represents a question related to the survey and number. Each SN is a respondents and the answers to each question are given in a Lickert scale (0-5).

dim(lrn14)
str(lrn14)
```


## 2.2 Scaling variables

The next step is [wrangling the data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) into a format that is easy to analyze. We will wrangle our data for the next few exercises. 

A neat thing about R is that may operations are *vectorized*. It means that a single operation can affect all elements of a vector. This is often convenient.

The column `Attitude` in `lrn14` is a sum of 10 questions related to students attitude towards statistics, each measured on the [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) (1-5). Here we'll scale the combination variable back to the 1-5 scale.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Pre-exercise-code (Run this code chunk first! Do NOT edit it.)

# Click the green arrow ("Run Current Chunk") in the upper-right corner of this chunk. This will initialize the R objects needed in the exercise. Then move to Instructions of the exercise to start working.

# read the data into memory
lrn14 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

```

### Instructions
- Execute the example codes to see how vectorized division works
- Use vector division to create a new column `attitude` in the `lrn14` data frame, where each observation of `Attitude` is scaled back to the original scale of the questions, by dividing it with the number of questions.

Hint:
- Assign 'Attitude divided by 10' to the new column 'attitude.

### R code
```{r}
lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10
```


## 2.3 Combining variables

Our data includes many questions that can be thought to measure the same *dimension*. You can read more about the data and the variables [here](http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-meta.txt). Here we'll combine multiple questions into combination variables. Useful functions for summation with data frames in R are

function      | description
------------- | ----------
`colSums(df)` | returns a sum of each column in `df`
`rowSums(df)` | returns a sum of each row in `df`
`colMeans(df)`| returns the mean of each column in `df`
`rowMeans(df)`| return the mean of each row in `df`

We'll combine the use of `rowMeans()`with the `select()` function from the **dplyr** library to average the answers of selected questions. See how it is done from the example codes.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Pre-exercise-code (Run this code chunk first! Do NOT edit it.)

# Click the green arrow ("Run Current Chunk") in the upper-right corner of this chunk. This will initialize the R objects needed in the exercise. Then move to Instructions of the exercise to start working.

# read the data into memory
lrn14 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10
```

### Instructions
- Access the **dplyr** library
- Execute the example codes to create the combination variables 'deep' and 'surf' as columns in `lrn14`
- Select the columns related to strategic learning from `lrn14`
- Create the combination variable 'stra' as a column in `lrn14`

Hints:
- Columns related to strategic learning are in the object `strategic_questions`. Use it for selecting the correct columns.
- Use the function `rowMeans()` identically to the examples

### R code
```{r}
# Work with the exercise in this chunk, step-by-step. Fix the R code!
# lrn14 is available

# Access the dplyr library
library(dplyr)

# questions related to deep, surface and strategic learning
deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")


# select the columns related to deep learning 
deep_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(deep_questions))
# and create column 'deep' by averaging
lrn14$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)

# select the columns related to surface learning 
surface_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(surface_questions))
# and create column 'surf' by averaging
lrn14$surf <- rowMeans(surface_columns)

# select the columns related to strategic learning 
strategic_columns <- select(lrn14, one_of(strategic_questions))
# and create column 'stra' by averaging
lrn14$stra <- rowMeans(strategic_columns)

```


## 2.4 Selecting columns

Often it is convenient to work with only a certain column or a subset of columns of a bigger data frame. There are many ways to select columns of data frame in R and you saw one of them in the previous exercise: `select()` from **dplyr***.

**dplyr** is a popular library for *data wrangling*. There are also convenient [data wrangling cheatsheets by RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) to help you get started (dplyr, tidyr etc.)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Pre-exercise-code (Run this code chunk first! Do NOT edit it.)

# Click the green arrow ("Run Current Chunk") in the upper-right corner of this chunk. This will initialize the R objects needed in the exercise. Then move to Instructions of the exercise to start working.

lrn14 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
lrn14$attitude <- lrn14$Attitude / 10
deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
lrn14$deep <- rowMeans(lrn14[, deep_questions])
surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
lrn14$surf <- rowMeans(lrn14[, surface_questions])
strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")
lrn14$stra <- rowMeans(lrn14[, strategic_questions])
```


### Instructions
- Access the **dplyr** library
- Create object `keep_columns`
- Use `select()` (possibly together with `one_of()`) to create a new data frame `learning2014` with the columns named in `keep_columns`.
- Look at the structure of the new dataset

Hint:
- See the previous exercise or the data wrangling cheatsheet for help on how to select columns

### R code
```{r}
# Work with the exercise in this chunk, step-by-step. Fix the R code!

# lrn14 is available

# access the dplyr library
library(dplyr)

# choose a handful of columns to keep
keep_columns <- c("gender","Age","attitude", "deep", "stra", "surf", "Points")

# select the 'keep_columns' to create a new dataset
learning2014 <- select(lrn14,all_of(keep_columns))

# see the structure of the new dataset

print(learning2014)
```
## 2.5 Modifying column names

Sometimes you want to rename your column. You could do this by creating copies of the columns with new names, but you can also directly get and set the column names of a data frame, using the function `colnames()`.

The **dplyr** library has a `rename()` function, which can also be used. Remember [the cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

### Instructions
- Print out the column names of `learning2014`
- Change the name of the second column to 'age'
- Change the name of 'Points' to 'points'
- Print out the column names again to see the changes

Hint:
- You can use `colnames()` similarily to the example. Which index matches the column 'Points'?

### R code

```{r}
print(names(learning2014))
colnames(learning2014)[2] <- "age"
learning2014 <- rename(learning2014, points = Points)
```

```{r}
print(dim(learning2014)) #check the dimension now (must have 166 rown and 7)
```

## 2.6 Excluding observations

Often your data includes outliers or other observations which you wish to remove before further analysis. Or perhaps you simply wish to work with some subset of your data. 

In the **learning2014** data the variable 'points' denotes the students exam points in a statistics course exam. If the student did not attend an exam, the value of 'points' will be zero. We will remove these observations from the data.

### R code
```{r, echo=FALSE}
learning2014 <- learning2014[learning2014$points > 0,]
```

### Instructions
- Access the **dplyr** library
- As an example, create object `male_students` by selecting the male students from `learning2014`
- Override `learning2014` and select rows where the 'points' variable is greater than zero. 
- If you do not remember how logical comparison works in R, see the 'Logical comparison' exercise from the course 'R Short and Sweet'.

Hint:
- The "greater than" logical operator is `>`

```{r}
dim(lrn14)
dim(learning2014)

#Export csv file
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/IODS-project")
write_csv(learning2014, 'learning2014.csv')

```
